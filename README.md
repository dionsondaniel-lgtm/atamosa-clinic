# Atamosa Pediatric Care Platform

**A Modern, Friendly Solution for Busy Clinics.** 🩺✨

Welcome! This repository hosts the source code for the **Atamosa Clinic Management System**, a specialized software designed to help Pediatricians in the Philippines simplify their daily operations.

Unlike generic hospital software, this was built specifically to solve the headaches of private practice: crowded waiting rooms, lost patient cards, and late-night text inquiries.

## 🌟 Why Doctors Love This
*   **The "Quiet Lobby" System:** Real-time queueing means patients wait at home or in their car, not in your clinic.
*   **Your AI Assistant:** Integrated Gemini AI helps double-check dosages and triage symptoms instantly.
*   **Digital Secretary:** Reduces repetitive text messages by allowing parents to book slots directly.
*   **Secure & Private:** Built with Supabase to ensure patient data stays safe and encrypted.

## 🛠️ The Tech Behind It
Built with the latest reliable web technologies:
*   React & TypeScript (Fast & Bug-free)
*   Supabase (Real-time Database)
*   Google Gemini AI (Medical Assistance)
*   Tailwind CSS (Clean, Modern UI)
